\subsubsection{Neural networks}

\paragraph{Backpropagation networks}

There are two ways in which we can derive the backpropagation-algorithm. One is purely analytical, the other bayesian. We'll demonstrate both. 

\paragraph{Gaussian processes}

The bayesian derivation of the backpropagation algorithm gives rise to the interesting idea that backprop-networks may be generalized into ...

\paragraph{Convolutional networks}

These are the networks most commonly found employed as a deep-learning architecture.

\paragraph{Feature detection and pose estimation}

Say you want to locate the position of the nose in a portrait.
