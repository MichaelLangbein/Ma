\paragraph{Backpropagation networks}

There are two ways in which we can derive the backpropagation-algorithm. One is purely analytical, the other bayesian. We'll demonstrate both. 

\paragraph{Gaussian processes}

The bayesian derivation of the backpropagation algorithm gives rise to the interesting idea that backprop-networks may be generalized into ...
