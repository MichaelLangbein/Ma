\subsection{Projections}

\subsection{Zoom to width/height}
Zoom is defined as follows: assume the whole world is displayed in a tile of red * 360 by res * 180 pixels. This tile has zoomlevel 0.

$$ h째 = 180째 0.5^z $$
$$ w째 = 360째 0.5^z $$

\subsection{Apparent height}
Imagine you were a bird flying over a flat map, your head pointing north and facing down. Your apparent height based on the maps width would be:

$$ h = frac{w}{2 \tan(\theta / 2)} $$
