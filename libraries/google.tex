\subsection{Firebase}
Contrary to GAE, in firebase, frontend-clients talk to a standard-api for the different services, not to your self-scripted Flask-server. However, there is still scripting: you can hook into the services' execution by using callbacks. 

\subsection{Google apps script}
This is similar to what apple once did with applescript, but hosted on google cloud.
