\subsection{Datatypes}

\subsubsection{How to store real numbers}

\subsubsection{How to store unstructured data}
For example binary data, timeseries, etc.

\subsection{Normal forms}

\subsection{Table-engines}


\subsection{Replication}
This section handles master-slave replication. 


\subsection{Cluster}

Clusters are good at making sure that one machines death doesn't lead to you loosing data. They work like NAS-servers in that they keep copies of your data on mulitple machines. 

A cluster of serveral machines acts like one big machine. To ensure that the cluster can survive the death of one machine, every line that is imported into the cluster is written to at least two machines.
