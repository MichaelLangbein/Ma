\section{Linux}

As much as I prefer linux over other os'es, most of the daily work with it is just memorizing some magic spells in arcane syntax and learning to type really fast. 

\subsection{System}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \inlinecode{shutdown}
    \item \inlinecode{reboot}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Searching}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \inlinecode{grep -rn --include=\*.{php,inc} "some text" .}
    \item \inlinecode{find . }
\end{itemize}


\subsection{startup}

\subsubsection{SytemV}
Old, sequential startup system. Runlevel based. 
Scripts in \inlinecode{/etc/init.d/}

\subsubsection{Upstart}
Ubuntus attempt at replacing systemv. Dependency-tree based.  Will soon be given up for systemd. 
Scripts in \inlinecode{/etc/init/}

\subsubsection{Systemd}
New, event based startup system.
