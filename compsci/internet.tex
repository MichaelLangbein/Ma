\section{Internet - practical aspects}

While the important theoretical aspects of the internet have been discussed in the section \emph{networking}, there are so many important details that we devote another section purely to those. 

\subsection{Nomenclature}

\begin{itemize}
	\item url
	\item uri
	\item domain
	\item 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Cookies}

Since http is a stateless protocol, we need some helper to store state over several page-visists. 

\paragraph{Cookie-domain}: A cookie is stored on the browser and only passed allong to the server with an http-request if the requested url matches the cookie-domain.
