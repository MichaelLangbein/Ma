\section{Labeling radar-movies with likely summer-thunderstorms}

Summer-thunderstorms are notoriously hard to predict. But we have an abundance of radar-data, together with decent records of actual precipitation.


\begin{itemize}
  \item Create labeled data
    \begin{itemize}
      \item When there is a thunderstorm about to come in the next three hours, label as "upcomming"
      \item When there is a storm happening, label as "active"
      \item When the storm is receding, label as "receding"
      \item Otherwise, label as "clear"
    \end{itemize}
   \item Train a net to recognize the labels given a 10-hour radar-movie
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Lower layers: 3d-conv
      \item Higher layers: dense
    \end{itemize}
   \item FInd out what the model has learned
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Are the conv-patterns interesting? Can they be used to find the outlines of a storm-cell?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
