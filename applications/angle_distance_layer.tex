\section{A custom type of neural-net layer}

Convolutional layers have proven valuable in extracting hierarchical features from an image. While this 

\subsection{Idea 1: reacting to the relation between features}
angle between features
distance between features


\subsection{Idea 2: Actively searching for hints of a given model}
active search: convolutional layers take in images without prejudice: they will passively take in any feature that might pop up in an image. But what if we want our net to already have a specific feature - say, a face - in mind, and look for it in its input?
