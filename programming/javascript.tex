\subsection{Promises, async-await and rxjs}
\inlinecode{async} - \inlinecode{await} lets you handle asynchronous code as if it was synchronous.

\subsection{WASM}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If wasm does not get a garbage-collector, 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item there will be no easy way for non-gc languages to run in wasm. They need to bring their own gc (or even runtime) with them (like c\# does now). 
            \item In that case, a situation like python + numy will probably evolve.
        \end{itemize}
    \item If wasm will not allow DOM-manipulation, 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item then there really is no point for non nummeric-focussed languages to be implemented in wasm.
            \item In that case, a situation like python + numy will probably evolve.
        \end{itemize}
    \item If, however, wasm will get a gc and allow DOM-manipulation, 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Then python, ruby etc. will all develop angular-clones to run on the web. 
            \item However, given the large js-ecosystem, those will not kick in too mightily. 
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
