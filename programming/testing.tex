\section{Testing}

When you're taking over a project, your job is to make changes while also ensuring that old functionality doesn't break. To achieve this, here is how you might structure your work: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Get a copy of the database and the production server. 
    \item Make a bunch of selenium tests. Ideally, let an existing dev walk you through site-features while recording. 
    \item Find the functionality you need to change. Create unit tests for all existing functions that call your new functionality to ensure their output stays the same.
    \item Do the actual changes. 
\end{itemize}
